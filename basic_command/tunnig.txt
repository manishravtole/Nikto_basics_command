Tuning and scan type of Nikto :-

1) nikto -h 192.168.0.106/dvwa/ -T 4 
Details: -T controls which tests Nikto runs. The tuning levels are:

0: File Upload

1: Interesting File / Seen in logs

2: Misconfiguration / Default File

3: Information Disclosure

4: Injection (XSS/Script/HTML)

5: Remote File Retrieval

6: Denial of Service

7: Remote Shell / Command Execution

x: Reverse Tuning (e.g., -T x45 runs all checks except Injection and Remote File Retrieval)

This command (-T 4) specifically looks for injection vulnerabilities.

2) nikto -update 
Details :- This is crucila before the running the scanning and we need to update the nikto database
